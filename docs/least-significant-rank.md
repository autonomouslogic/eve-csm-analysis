# Least Significant Rank

The least significant rank is calculated by taking all votes cast and removing the higher rank votes to see
if that removal would affect the outcome of the election.
For instance, if you had voted for (A, B, C, D)  then a least significant rank of 3 would mean that if all votes higher than
rank 3 (D in this case) votes were removed, the election would still be the same.
